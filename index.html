            <p>
                My name is Chris Mitchell.
                Currently, I am the Assistant Store Manager at the Seward Co-op Friendship
                Store. There I work to ensure staff and customer
                safety, maintenance of the physical store structure, and support of sales
                departments. As for personnel, I manage the facilities
                department's two roles, <em>Manager on Duty</em> and <em>Housekeeper</em>. I am responsible for
                directing the goals for the department, ensure
                proper training, develop new practices, ensure efficient work flow, and hold
                staff accountable to the department's and
                organization's policies and expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                While my experience as the Assistant Store Manager has provided me with a
                tremendous amount of important lessons and growth, I
                have decided to begin my first steps toward a career that is within my
                interests. Coding Bootcamp is a program that I am currently
                participating in to help teach me fundamental full stack web development. I
                believe that this program will give me the tools to
                help push me into a field that I find both exciting and rewarding.
